chanclone
=========
Chanclone is a clone of the \*chan image boards. This is not necessarily
based off of any \*chan board in particular. Rather, it is my
interpretation of all of the \*chan boards that I have frequented, all
squished together. Rather than using PHP or a Perl script to statically
render webpages, chanclone uses Flask, a Python webkit.

Dependencies
------------
Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org)

TODO List
=========
* Add frames around the thumbnail images
* Prettify the website
* Add file metadata (original name, size, etc)
* Add file size cap
* Get the last five responses when displaying threads
